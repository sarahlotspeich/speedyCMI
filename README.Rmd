```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

This repository contains R code and simulation data to reproduce results from the [manuscript]() by Sarah C. Lotspeich and Ethan M. Alt (2023+). 

## Package Installation

Installation of the `speedyCMI` from GitHub requires the
[`devtools`](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/devtools.html)
package and can be done in the following way.

``` r
# Install the package
devtools::install_github(repo = "sarahlotspeich/speedyCMI", 
                         ref = "main")
```

```{r}
# Load the package
library(speedyCMI)
```

## Functions 

The `speedyCMI` package contains separate functions to run conditional mean imputation (CMI) for censored covariates using the different formulas discussed in the corresponding paper. Using the following simulated dataset, we provide a brief overview of these functions and their use below. 

```{r}
set.seed(918) # For reproducibility
n = 1000 # Sample size
z = rbinom(n = n, size = 1, prob = 0.5) # Uncensored covariate
x = rweibull(n = n, shape = 0.75, scale = 0.25 + 0.25 * z)  # To-be-censored covariate
e = rnorm(n = n, mean = 0, sd = 1) # Random errors
y = 1 + 0.5 * x + 0.25 * z + e # Continuous outcome
q = 0.5 # Rate parameter for censoring
c = rexp(n = n, rate = q) # Random censoring mechanism
w = pmin(x, c) # Observed covariate value
d = as.numeric(x <= c) # "Event" indicator
dat = data.frame(x, z, w, y, d) # Construct data set
head(dat) # Inspect data set
```

The functions are first introduced for single imputation, before providing an example with multiple imputation. 

### 1. Parametric (Original Integral)

```{r}
# Single parametric CMI using the original integral formula
imp_dat = cmi_fp_original(imputation_formula = Surv(time = w, event = d) ~ z,
                          dist = "weibull",
                          W = "w",
                          Delta = "d",
                          data = dat)

## Inspect the return object (list)
head(imp_dat$imputed_data) ### completed dataset with new column "imp" 
imp_dat$code ### logical indicator for whether or not imputation model converged

## Fit the analysis model to singly imputed data
lm(y ~ imp + z, data = imp_dat$imputed_data)
```
